Installation notes for OptiMAS Version 1.0
======================================================================

This file describes the building and installation instructions from the SOURCES for all supported systems.

As ready-to-use binaries installation packages are provided for Windows and MacOSX platforms,
we only describe the step for compiling OptiMAS binaries, without providing a "shell" script for these platforms.

For GNU/Linux plateforms, use the "install_optimas_on_linux.sh" shell script to build and install OptiMAS on your system.

Getting OptiMAS version 1.0 sources
===================================

Official web site: https://www.integratedbreeding.net/ib-tools/breeding-decision/optimas

Supported Systems
=================

Will work in most modern GNU/Linux, Windows (XP or later),
and MacOSX (10.5 or later with Intel processor) systems.

Building Prerequisite
=====================

1. GNU compiler collections with c++ support (g++ version 4.0.1 or later)

  http://gcc.gnu.org/

2. Qt development package (version 4.4.3 or later)

  http://qt.nokia.com/products/

3. qwt development package version 5.X.X (version 6 IS NOT supported yet).

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/qwt

4. graphviz development package (version 2.20.2 or later)

  http://www.graphviz.org/

NB: Only the complete installation, including the Graphical User Interface (GUI), needs Qt, qwt and graphviz packages.

Install
=======

   A. GNU/Linux (tested on Debian, Unbuntu and Fedora)

	We STRONGLY recommand to have g++, make, Qt, qwt and graphviz installed via the
	package manager of your GNU/linux distribution.
	
	e.g.:
	
	on Debian/Ubuntu plateforms (as root or sudoer):
	apt-get install make
	apt-get install g++
	apt-get install libqt4-dev
	apt-get install libqwt5-qt4-dev
	apt-get install libgraphviz-dev
	
	on Redhat/Fedora/CentOS plateforms (as root or sudoer):
	yum install make
	yum install gcc-c++
	yum install qt4-devel
	yum install qwt-devel
	yum install graphviz-devel

	To build and install OptiMAS on linux platforms, open a terminal
	and run the installation shell script:
	
	./install_optimas_on_linux.sh [--no-gui]
	
	As root (or sudoer), it will perform an installation for all users.
	As a common user, it will perform a local install (user's personal directory).
	
	Use the « --no-gui » option as an argument, to install optimas, the command line interface analyse tool, without installing the GUI (optimas_gui).
	
	NB: if the installation script fails in finding qwt and/or graphviz
	libraries paths on your system, you can specify them in the config.in file.

	To uninstall OptiMAS, run the script uninstall_optimas.sh located in the same directory as optimas_gui and/or optimas binaries.

   B. Windows (32 bits).
	
	1. Development environment:
	   - Mingw or Visual C++ (VC) last release compiler suite.
	   - Qt development kit (Mingw or VC version).
	   - qwt and graphviz development packages.
	
	2. In the optimas directory, build optimas using make (installed with Mingw)
	   or nmake -f makefile_vc (installed with VC).

	3. In the optimas_gui directory:
	 
	 - Edit optimas_gui.pro and set INCLUDEPATH and LIBS
	   variables in the win32 scope to specify qwt and
	   graphviz include directories and libraries
	   to be linked into the project.
	 
	 - generate the Makefile: qmake optimas_gui.pro
	 
	 - Build optimas_gui.exe: make release (with Mingw) or nmake release (with VC)
	   => the binary is in the release directory

	4. To run optimas_gui properly, the optimas executable (build at step 2) has to be placed in the software directory

	5. To make an installation package we recommand to use Inno Setup software.
	   files to include in the package: DLLs etc ... 

   C. MacOSX (10.5 or newer with Intel architecture).

	1. Development environment:

	 - Get XCode (version 3.1.3 or later) and mac-port from official
	   apple web site.
	 - Install graphviz and qwt via mac-port (as root):
	   sudo port install graphviz
	   sudo port install qwt52
	   
	   NOTE: Installing from mac-port is much longer but much safer.
	   This will install Qt as dependencies. 
	
	2. In the optimas directory, build optimas via the following command:
	   make

	3. In the optimas_gui directory:
	 
	 - Edit optimas_gui.pro and set INCLUDEPATH and LIBS
	   variables in the macx scope to specify qwt and
	   graphviz include directories and libraries
	   to be linked into the project.
	 
	 - generate the makefile: qmake optimas_gui.pro
	 
	 - Build optimas_gui via make.
	   => the binary is in optimas_gui.app/Contents/MacOS/
	   
	4. Copy optimas binary to the software/ folder.

	5. Copy the doc/ input/ output/ website/ and software/ directories
	   in optimas_gui.app/Contents/MacOS/

	6. Join the Qt shared libraries to the optimas_gui.app package
	   by running the following command:
	   macdeployqt optimas_gui.app
	   
	7. graphviz dylib stuff ...


NOTE: To launch analysis via the command line, it is not necessary
to specify the complet path if the binaries (optimas and optimas_gui executable)
directory is present in the PATH environment variable.
